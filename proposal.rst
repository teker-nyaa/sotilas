The main goal of this projects is to create a very low spec game with mechanics similar to that of Creulty Squad. The engine powering this game will be completely custom made and will not be based on any previous engine. I believe that this would help me with algorithims, data, and the impact of computing. I will try my best to make the game as accesible as possible.

Here is a list of things that I hope the engine will support (beyond basic game engine stuff):

1. Colored lighting
	* May have to change this depending on the rendering API
	* Will be supported on OpenGL and WGPU
2. Binary Space Partitioning
	* This is going to be hard because of the way that the algorithim works
	* Will also make level designand loading very easy
3. OBJ models
	* 3D modeling will be far easier with this
4. OS support for Windows XP, Linux Kernel 3, and OSX
5. Scripting and modding support with Lua and the 7z format
